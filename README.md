# Module 9 | Assignment - Surfs Up

Analyzed climate data using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.


Surfs Up challenge

I used Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy, to filter the dates for the month of June and December retrieved the temperatures for the month of for June. The temperatures were converted into a list, a DataFrame was created from the list, and the summary statistic was generated. Using similar filters data was retrieved using the temperatures for the month of December. And the temperatures convert again using the same method. The month of June and December data was used to describe summer and winter temperatures across a seven-year period.  Meanwhile. Junes temperature flactuated between 65°F and 80° whereas, December low temperature of 56°F and 84°F. During this time period, both June and December had an average temperature of 75°F and and 71°F.
